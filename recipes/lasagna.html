		<p><i>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers wide, flat pasta with a rich combination of savory fillings. Each layer typically includes a hearty meat sauce made from ground beef or sausage, simmered with tomatoes, garlic, and herbs for a deep, robust flavor. This is paired with creamy ricotta or béchamel sauce, which adds a smooth, luscious texture. Melted mozzarella and grated Parmesan are generously sprinkled between layers, giving the dish its signature cheesy goodness. Baked until golden and bubbling, lasagna offers a satisfying balance of flavors and textures, making it a comforting favorite for family dinners and special gatherings alike.</i></p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
